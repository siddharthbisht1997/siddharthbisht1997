### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Siddharth. I currently work as a Data Scientist/Developer. At times I am out of words regarding my work. What do I do everyday? Well, it is not that difficult. I solve problems, sometimes my own but mostly I solve the Business Problems for our Customers across the Globe.

I think that I am a decent Data Professional, with ability to solve a Data Science Problem. Hidden details may include techniques like "Fancy Neural Network", or a simple "Logistic Regression" Model. How I reach to conclusions about my solutions is a tad bit "lazy". I minimize my effort and pay attention to the outcome of the model in my selection strategy. Explainability and understanding drives my modeling.

I humbly believe that today we all have Thor's Hammer but that does not make everything a Nail. I like to visualize the data, and hear me out. I use UI Tools a lot. I am not your Full Code, No Code or even Low Code Data Scientist. I use Excel when needed, I use Power BI when needed, I use Python when needed. I even copy code from various tutorials when I cannot remember for 100th time how to use loc and iloc in pandas.

Rest assured I think I can do it.
